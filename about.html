            <p><b><br>I’m Donna Marie C. Siobal, currently taking up Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering 
            at Pangasinan State University Urdaneta Campus. Having some knowledge about the syntax and algorithms 
            of C++, Java, and Python. I love playing mobile games, especially mobile legends, and that inspires me 
            to become part of their team to share the ideas that I have and showcase my capability.  </br>
            <br>Away from the keyboard in my spare time, I usually watch Korean dramas that inspire me to work harder 
            to visit Korea and meet those famous celebrities that I adore. In addition, having fun with my dogs is one 
            of the greatest moments that I will treasure in my life as they bring out the child on me. </br> 
            <br>I’m good at building a relationship with other people thus, they can easily approach me and 
            communicate without hesitation. As a dedicated, industrious, and result-oriented woman, I strive to get 
            the greatest possible outcome in every endeavor I do. </br></b></p>
